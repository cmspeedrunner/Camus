# Camus
Camus is a esoteric programming language named after the particularly descriptive writer Albert Camus<br>

The idea for Camus is to create a programming language with all human readable words, no symbols. It is turing complete and allows reading and writing of data, and changing that data to do things like converting it to a string, num, float or a boolean, adding it or evaluating it. Examples are in the project but here are some important things to note.

## Syntax

The syntax isnt neccesarily syntax but some important things to note is that, you can just do a space, if you wanted to output hello world it would look like this<br>
`display openbracket string Hello comma wspace World emark string closebracket`<br>
In this example the "comma", "wspace" and "emark" are very important because you cannot type symbols, and one of these is technically a space, so you must type a wspace, all spaces you type are removed by default because otherwise the interpreter wouldnt be able to do its thing.<br>



## Comments
Blank lines are ignored by the intepreter but to do a comment you must do<br>
`commenthere This is the comment, You can use all the symbols you want here, they are not factored in, rather passed`
